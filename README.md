# Backpacks, a simple plugin for vanilla users

How to use 101

1. grab a shulker box and hold it via main hand (offhand it not available at this time)
2. sneak and right the shulker box on your hand to open a preview of your shulker
3. you can now move items around except your shulker box (will added a checker other box shulkers later)

Simple as that, have fun.
